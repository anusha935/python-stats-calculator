Statistics Calculator in Python (Object-Oriented)

This version of the Statistics Calculator was implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and executed inside a Jupyter Notebook environment.

How the Program Works

The program defines a class called StatisticsCalculator, which encapsulates both:

the list of integers, and

the methods to compute

mean

median

mode

Python’s built-in features such as sorted() and collections.Counter help simplify the implementation.

How to Run (Jupyter Notebook)

Open Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda, VS Code, or online Jupyter).

Create a new notebook.

Copy the entire statistics.py code into a code cell.

Run the cell to display the output.

No external libraries are required.

Example Output
Mean: 2.4
Median: 2
Mode: [2]

Input

The list of integers can be modified directly inside the notebook:

numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]

Paradigm Explanation

This implementation demonstrates the object-oriented paradigm, where:

data and behavior are grouped together

methods operate on internal object state

the code is modular and reusable
